Artistverse
Artistverse is an innovative project that merges art, mathematics, and physics to create dynamic fractal-based visuals in a 3D environment using Three.js. With the ability to manipulate a single image into mesmerizing fractal patterns, this project serves as an artistic expression of the interconnectedness of the universe. The fractal engine at the heart of this project reveals infinite beauty and complexity from a single input, offering a visual representation of the universe's repeating structures.

Features
Dynamic Fractal Visualization: Transform a single image into fractal patterns by adjusting the scene's movement and spin to create new fractals dynamically.
3D Environment: Built with Three.js, providing an interactive experience with FlyControls for immersive exploration.
Interactivity: Users can manipulate the 3D scene in real time, altering the fractal patterns through movement and interaction.
Fractal Generation: Based on recursive algorithms, each iteration of the image evolves into complex fractal formations, mimicking the universeâ€™s natural patterns.
Visual Representation of Physics: The spinning, scaling, and shifting of fractals within the 3D space highlights the beauty of chaotic systems and physics in action.
Cross-Disciplinary: Combines concepts from mathematics, art, and physics to create a cohesive and visually stunning experience.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ClickClickDerk/Artistverse.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Artistverse
Install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start a local server to run the project (e.g., using http-server or live-server):

bash
Copy code
npx http-server
Open your browser and view the project at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
Once the project is loaded in your browser, interact with the 3D scene using the following controls:

Mouse/Trackpad: Click and drag to rotate the scene.
WASD keys: Move the camera forward, backward, and sideways.
Spacebar: Move the camera up.
Shift: Move the camera down.
As you explore the environment, fractal patterns will dynamically generate from the initial image, creating an ever-evolving piece of art.

Support
I could really use some support im unemployeed and with a project like this I want everyone to enjoy the beauty of art, math and physics as much as I do so if you dont have money to pay to play trust me understand that and this is the reason why I feel educational information needs to be as freely accessable as  much a possible. Cashapp $RachelNyx or PayPal Nyx4d. Thank you so much!
